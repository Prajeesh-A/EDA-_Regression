# Air Quality Prediction: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aimed at analyzing air quality data from the `city_day.csv` dataset. The analysis is performed in a Google Colab notebook and is designed to provide insights into air quality trends and factors influencing pollution levels in various cities.

## Dataset

**Dataset Name**: `city_day.csv`  
The dataset contains daily air quality measurements for various cities. It includes parameters like pollutant levels, Air Quality Index (AQI), and weather-related metrics.

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- **Date**: The date of measurement.
- **City**: The city where the measurement was recorded.
- **AQI (Air Quality Index)**: A composite measure of air pollution.
- **Pollutants**: Concentrations of pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.
- **Weather Metrics**: Optional columns related to temperature, humidity, etc.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
1. Understand the distribution and trends of air quality parameters.
2. Identify patterns and correlations among pollutants.
3. Explore city-wise and time-based variations in air quality.
4. Derive insights for air quality prediction and policy-making.

### Tools and Libraries
The analysis is performed using:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

## Contents of This Repository

- **`EDA-Project-Air Quality Prediction.ipynb`**: The main Colab notebook containing the code and analysis.
- **`city_day.csv`**: The dataset used in this analysis (ensure you upload this to the Colab runtime for execution).
- **Plots and Visualizations**: A variety of static and interactive visualizations to illustrate key insights.

## Steps to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prajeesh-A/EDA-_Regression.git
   cd EDA-_Regression
   ```
2. Open **`EDA-Project-Air Quality Prediction`** in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Upload the `city_day.csv` file to the Colab runtime when prompted.
4. Run the cells in sequence to explore the analysis.

## Key Insights

The EDA reveals:
- Seasonal trends in air pollution.
- Cities with consistently poor air quality.
- Key pollutants contributing to high AQI levels.
- Temporal patterns, such as weekend vs. weekday variations.

## Future Work

- Implement machine learning models for AQI prediction.
- Explore real-time data integration for dynamic analysis.
- Develop dashboards for air quality monitoring.
